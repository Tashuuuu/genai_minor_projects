1. THE SILENT STORM  
-----------------  
The wind does not howl,  
it whispers—  
a secret too heavy  
for the trees to hold.  

Leaves tremble,  
not from fear,  
but from the weight  
of unshed rain.  

I, too,  
am a storm  
that refuses  
to break.


2. CLOCKWORK HEARTS 
-----------------  
Tick-tock, the clockwork spins,  
a dance of gears beneath our skins.  
You wound me up, then walked away,  
now I chime for yesterday. 


3. GRAFFITI GHOSTS  
-----------------  
The walls remember  
what the city forgets—  
names in spray paint,  
fading, but not gone.  

I trace the letters,  
wondering if the streetlight  
still hums their song.


4. ODE TO A COFFEE STAIN  
-----------------  
Oh, chaotic brown bloom,  
you ruin reports and mock my haste.  
Yet without you,  
would mornings taste  
like productivity wasted?


5. THE BOOK THIEF'S LAMENT
-----------------  
I stole words once—  
plucked them from spines  
and tucked them under my tongue.  

Now my mouth is a library  
of stories I never wrote,  
and silence is the fine  
I cannot pay.


6. LIGHTHOUSE IN A SHOEBOX
-----------------  
I built a lighthouse  
inside a shoebox,  
just to prove  
darkness has edges.  

The switch is a toothpick,  
the bulb a firefly’s ghost.  
It flickers, but—  
oh, how it glows.


7. RECIPE FOR GOODBYE
-----------------  
Take one part silence,  
two parts maybe.  
Fold in the laughter  
you left in my pockets.  

Bake until the air smells  
like burnt sugar.  
Serve cold.  
(No one finishes it.)


8. ALGORITHM BLUES
-----------------  
My heart runs  
on binary:  
404 love not found,  
505 soul overload.  

Reboot.  
Try again tomorrow.


9. THE CROW'S BARGAIN
-----------------  
Bring me your sorrows,  
said the crow,  
and I’ll carry them  
to the moon.  

But the moon is a liar,  
and the crow—  
well, the crow  
works for the night.


10. HOW TO FOLD A MEMORY
-----------------  
Step 1: Flatten the corners.  
Step 2: Crease the laughter sharply.  
Step 3: Tuck the tears inside.  

Warning:  
Do not unfold  
near rain.
